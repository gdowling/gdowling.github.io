    "Analytics is an art reliant on free and creative thought mathematically grounded. This guide will show you how transfer your knowledge in R over to Python. Even if you do not have experience using R you will still be able to walk away with a fundamental working knowledge in Python. The code in this document will show how to translate each R function into Python as well as show Python best practices. After we cover the basics, Iâ€™ve include a ML project that shows steps from start to finish in both R and Python code.\n",
