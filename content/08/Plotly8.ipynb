    "```Plotly``` in my opinion the best option in python for making visualizations. Other options include ```matplotlib``` or ```seaborn```, but they lack the image quality, interactivity, and versatility that ```plotly``` offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below are a few more benefits noted by the developers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotly is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over _40 unique chart types_ covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Built on top of the Plotly JavaScript library, plotly enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Thanks to deep integration with the orca image export utility, plotly also provides great support for non-web contexts including desktop editors and static document publishing (exporting notebooks to PDF with high-quality vector images for use in programs such as PowerPoint)."
