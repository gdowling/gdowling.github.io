<h1 id="Installation">Installation<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installation"> </a></h1><p>The easiest way to install python is to use <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/">Anaconda</a>. Download the 64-bit version of Python 3.7.</p>
<p><strong>Anaconda will come with four main components:</strong></p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Python 3.7:</strong> this allows you to run Python</li>
<li><strong>Spyder:</strong> An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) similar to R-Studio. This is where you will work on most of your projects.</li>
<li><strong>Jupyter Notebook:</strong> Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment where you can write Python code. Popular because you can include easy to read text around you code to explain your process. Similar to R-Markdown.</li>
<li><strong>Anaconda Prompt:</strong> This is were you will go to download various Python packages. Similar to how you download packages in R (Will cover more on this later).</li>
