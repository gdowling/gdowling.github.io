<ul>
<li><strong>Lists:</strong> It is the same in Python as it is in R. It can store values of multiple variable types (i.e. floats, strings, booleans, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>Tuples:</strong> These are exclusive to Python. The closest thing in R would be a vector, but unlike a vector, tuples are immutable (i.e. they canâ€™t be changed).</li>
<li><strong>Dictionary:</strong> Found in both Python and R. It is a two-dimensional structure with a <em>key : value pair</em>. In simple terms the key would be a column and the value pair would be the column value.</li>
<li><strong>Dataframe:</strong> The dataframe is a two-dimensional with heterogeneous data (i.e. columns of any data type). Unlike R, Python does not come with a dataframe function out of the box so it must be downloaded using the <code>pandas</code> package (We will cover more on this later). The functionally of the dataframe is the same across both languages. </li>
<li><strong>Array:</strong> This is unique to Python and is similar to a list in R. It can be multidimensional and can contain data of the same or multiple classes.</li>
<li><strong>Matrix:</strong> Are found in both Python and R. A Matrix is similar to a dataframe; however, a matrix is homogeneous and a dataframe is not. A matrix, can reduce a memory usage.</li>
</ul>
