<h1 id="Plotly"><a href="https://plot.ly/python/getting-started/#overview">Plotly</a><a class="anchor-link" href="#Plotly"> </a></h1><p><code>Plotly</code> in my opinion the best option in python for making visualizations. Other options include <code>matplotlib</code> or <code>seaborn</code>, but they lack the image quality, interactivity, and versatility that <code>plotly</code> offers.</p>
<p>Below are a few more benefits noted by the developers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plotly is an interactive, open-source plotting library that supports over <em>40 unique chart types</em> covering a wide range of statistical, financial, geographic, scientific, and 3-dimensional use-cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Built on top of the Plotly JavaScript library, plotly enables Python users to create beautiful interactive web-based visualizations that can be displayed in Jupyter notebooks, saved to standalone HTML files, or served as part of pure Python-built web applications using Dash.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Thanks to deep integration with the orca image export utility, plotly also provides great support for non-web contexts including desktop editors and static document publishing (exporting notebooks to PDF with high-quality vector images for use in programs such as PowerPoint).</p>
